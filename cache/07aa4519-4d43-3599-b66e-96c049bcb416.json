that's a worthy trade off?\nWell I mean I think there's lots of waysof getting it in the first placewithout necessarily using ads.\nI mean, WhatsApp was free for the first year.", "paragraphs": ["Transcript", "Hi all.", "So I'm thrilled to have Brian Acton here.", "A lot of you know him as the co founder of WhatsApp.", "And some of you I'm sure know him also", "as the Executive Chair, were you the co founder", "of The Signal Foundation?", "Co founder of the Foundation, yes.", "Of the Foundation right, Signal preexisted.", "I'm just curious how many people use Signal here?", "Some, but some are Signaling, you know,", "some Signal yes but some we'll never know", "right you're not gonna tell me.", "[laughter]", "And this is great to follow and Anne Neuburger", "and we were just in the green room", "and learned that the NSA uses Signal.", "Yup.", "Of course if I were the NSA and I had broken", "the signal the first thing I would do", "is to tell Brian that we think it's secure.", "[laughter]", "So tell me, how did Signal start?", "How did you get involved with it?", "Is it tied to, and then the encryption in WhatsApp,", "what's the through line here?", "Well it's actually a longer history,", "a longer story than you may realize.", "In so far as Signal, as is it today", "was pre dated by Tech Secure,", "which was pre dated by RedPhone.", "And is really the efforts of Moxie Marlinspike,", "who I got the opportunity to meet", "in 2013 as part of WhatsApp.", "Moxie and I were introduced by a mutual", "colleague that we both knew.", "He and I chatted about incorporating", "end-to-end encryption into WhatsApp", "and then that led to the genesis", "of getting Moxie more heavily involved", "in a partnership agreement where we brought", "end-to-end encryption into WhatsApp.", "It took two years and we worked", "together in terms of rolling it out", "and making sure that it went out successfully.", "And you know the project was a success.", "I mean, we were able to bring state of the art", "Double Ratchet protocol encryption", "to WhatsApp which is head and shoulders", "above what anyone else had been doing at the time.", "Why was that important to you?", "So that's how you did it,", "but why did that resonate with you?", "And why did you think that you should", "integrate it into your product", "which was growing like crazy and at that point", "you had hundreds of millions of people right?", "Yeah, around 2014 I think we had", "400 million users on WhatsApp at the time.", "I think what I was concerned about", "was sort of a growing sort of desire", "from law enforcement to get essentially", "blanket rights to surveil.", "That law enforcement would just throw", "a subpoena at us one after the other", "and just give us lists of phone numbers.", "And I didn't wanna be in the business", "of having to do that.", "Actually in 2009 I joked with Jan,", "my co founder of WhatsApp,", "I joked with him at the time I was like,", "You know, this may be a real problem.", "And sure enough, you know three, four years later", "the number of inbound requests", "to WhatsApp started growing and I just felt", "that it was inappropriate to be, you know,", "given these requested and having", "in volume essentially kind of a Dragnets", "sort of mass surveillance set up.", "Well, and you did it at a weird time", "because I think at the time you know maybe", "it was just that period where you agreed", "to be purchased by Facebook right,", "and the deal hadn't gone through is that right?", "We started the process of end-to-end encryption", "in 2013 which preceded the acquisition completely.", "But we were clear with Mark upfront", "that we were gonna do encryption", "and he was like, Yeah okay that makes sense,", "let's go ahead and do it.", "All right, I mean he was just like okay fine.", "Do you think that he then said to other people", "Gee, what does this mean for us legally?", "Because it's a complicated thing", "for Facebook to get into this.", "Right, I think that he had a reasonable", "understanding of it, I don't know if he completely", "in 2014 understood the full ramifications of everything.", "But on the face of it I think he was supportive.", "And when you integrated that,", "Facebook to it's credit stood up for you folks.", "But there were problems.", "People said the encryption helped shield", "really bad things and downstairs", "we were in conversation with Anne", "and she said that she would ask you", "a question that I was gonna ask you.", "Is, what about those things in Myanmar", "and India where people used WhatsApp", "and they were able to shroud their bad intentions?", "Well I think you always have the situation", "where bad actors exist in a system.", "And bad actors unfortunately are going to", "go to any means to conduct their bad business.", "Bad actors have had access to encryption", "long before WhatsApp rolled out encryption,", "long before Signal rolled out encryption.", "What Signal and WhatsApp do is we bring", "encryption to the masses, right.", "We bring it to everyone so that everyone", "is afforded a level of protection", "that they weren't afforded before.", "I mean, compare it to 20 years ago when it was all SMS,", "you know there's no encryption there,", "there's you know you just throw something", "at the phone company and you get", "a mass fire hose of information.", "Well, you know, how many people use Signal?", "We don't really have good data", "because we don't track really anything about our users.", "You know how many people download it right?", "Right, we have over 10 million downloads,", "you can see that on the app stores.", "And we model pretty closely the sort of", "90 10 ratio of Android versus iPhone.", "That is Global Market Share as well.", "You know it's kind of interesting.", "So I wrote a book about cryptography", "and the crypto wars in the 90's.", "And when it ended so it was possible to do", "something like Signal or put end-to-end", "encryption in WhatsApp, I assume that then", "it would explode because gee why wouldn't people", "wanna communicate privately?", "And you say 10 million, that's a lot of people.", "You couldn't fit 'em into this room", "But compared to the scale that you saw", "in WhatsApp compared to Facebook scale,", "that's just a drop in the bucket.", "Why do you think that more people", "don't use what you've produced", "which amazing is an amazingly", "simple way to use it for the first time,", "it's just as easy as using any other app.", "And I would have thought that more people would've used it.", "Why aren't people using it more?", "I think that there's a global education", "that's happening and it's sort of a slow,", "you know it's sort of, back in the 90's", "we all got the same hoax emails", "and we all learned to ignore them.", "Right, the Nigerian Princes and all that fun stuff.", "So nowadays the topic of privacy,", "the topic of security is coming up to", "the popular discussions and so now we're in a position", "where people are becoming more self educated", "about what is actually my personally", "identifying information, how is it being used,", "what is the contents of my conversations.", "And now they're wanting privacy and security", "built into the products.", "They wanting it built into the terms of service.", "And you know at Signal we have all of that, right.", "We take privacy and security to,", "in my opinion the next level.", "We not only protect your message contents", "but we also protect your message metadata.", "So we take it a step further.", "Well it's interesting because Facebook", "says that when they're criticized for", "leaving end-to-end encryption in WhatsApp,", "they say well there's other ways", "that people can get at it including the metadata.", "The metadata for those that don't know", "is stuff like, who's talking to who,", "and to find the patterns of what you're talking to.", "And then they've done things like control", "how many times you could forward a message.", "And you don't like that do you?", "No.", "I mean I think in general we wanna be", "in the business of not knowing anything", "about the people that use our product", "and not being able to police the users", "that use our product.", "So down there in the green room", "we were having this discussion,", "Anne quoted Edmund Burke as I guess", "people of the NSA want to do.", "She said that, All that is necessary for the triumph", "of evil is for good men to do nothing there.", "Did that resinate with you or", "do you just outright reject it?", "I see it in a different way.", "If you look at the global landscape", "we have a growing problem", "of cyber security and cyber warfare.", "We have foreign entities that are", "interfering in conversations,", "they're interfering in elections,", "they're interfering in all kinds of things.", "We need more security, we don't need less.", "We need more encryption not less.", "So when you have a product like Signal,", "where we bring it to the masses,", "we're actually bringing more safety to you.", "We are the good men doing good things, right.", "And we are taking action.", "So you feel that by having this in people hands", "that the benefit to people is gonna outweigh", "those times when people abuse it?", "I don't view it as a balance of the scales.", "The scales of justice per se,", "I view it as sort of raising the bar globally.", "I view it as the bad guys are always", "gonna be bad guys they're always gonna", "go out of their way to go get that stick", "of dynamite or go get that some sort of munition.", "That's what the bad guys are gonna do.", "But the good guys, the lawyers,", "the doctors, the activists, the press,", "they need stronger protections", "and they need the education right?", "Part of the Foundations mission is also education.", "That's part of the 501[c][3] that we've become.", "And so lately we've been noticing", "that actually not so much from the NSA", "but from the Justice Department, and Homeland Security,", "and the equivalent agencies in other countries,", "there's been more pressure against", "this bout of encryption and the going dark scenario", "is being invoked and there was a recent letter", "from Attorney General Barr and an Official in Australia,", "and Official in the U.K, and the no longer", "interim head of DHS that was saying,", "you know, they asked Facebook to stop", "it's efforts to use end-to-end encryption in Messenger.", "And you know they're going to indicate", "there's gonna be more pressure", "against companies like Signal,", "or efforts like Signal.", "Does that worry you?", "Do you think that there's going to be a clamor", "to not do what you can do?", "I think we are going to continue", "to push forward on our mission", "in a way in which I am not worried, no.", "I think that we will continue to push forward", "on our mission, we will continue to innovate in security,", "we will continue to protect user's privacy.", "And I think it's gonna be very hard", "for American law to change in such a way", "that any sort of mechanism gets created.", "Now since you left WhatsApp and Facebook,", "Mark Zuckerberg has announced what he calls", "a privacy focused vision.", "And that's to add encryption and blend", "the encryption system that they use in WhatsApp", "with the other messaging services,", "Messenger,", "and Facebook itself", "will be one big family where everything's all encrypted.", "Is that good?", "Do you like that?", "You know I'd like to say that for", "the Signal Foundation, mission accomplished.", "But I think that Mark has set himself up", "with a very tall order and I think that", "it's going to be years in the making.", "So I think the proof is really gonna be in the pudding,", "And how well Facebook can execute against", "that decided mission and that decided strategy.", "They're facing internal hurdles themselves,", "you know internal backlash,", "their own executives questioning it.", "I mean they're gonna have to go through", "a lot of that just to achieve it.", "And one of them is gonna be here later today I think.", "Yes he is.", "[laughter]", "And I think that more power to Facebook", "if they accomplish it.", "But I think that it's a tall order,", "with a lot of contingencies built against it", "that it's gonna be difficult for them", "to be successful at it.", "Do you think that it's being done in good faith?", "I mean with the interactions you've had", "with Mark do you think he's a true believer now?", "In encryption, he's seen what it did with WhatsApp.", "I think it's difficult for me to sort of,", "get into the head of Mark Zuckerberg in this regard.", "[Steven] In any regard?", "I think all we can do is judge him", "by the history of the actions that the company has chosen.", "The company has made decisions", "at various times to go in certain directions", "and lead certain initiatives to acquire certain companies.", "If Mark wants to make it happen,", "I think he'll work hard to make it happen.", "Mark may change his mind.", "He's been known to change his mind.", "Well, you once posted after you left", "hashtag delete Facebook.", "I did.", "[laughter]", "Why did you do that?", "You know at the time there was", "some press unfolding against Facebook.", "The beginnings of the Cambridge Analytica revelations", "and I was also had read a couple blog posts", "about this is what it takes to get", "your data out of Facebook.", "And I was like oh okay well maybe it's time to.", "I wasn't really a heavy user of Facebook anyway,", "so I was like okay maybe it's time I'll delete myself.", "But then I realized that a fatal flaw", "in Facebook and I think it's deliberate,", "is they don't have tombstones.", "So you can't say so long and thanks for the fish.", "You actually, when you disappear you disappear, right.", "So I couldn't leave a tombstone saying,", "Hey I left go find me somewhere else.", "So I left my tombstone on Twitter,", "which to my chagrin was a lot more public", "and a lot more visible than I was necessarily expecting.", "Well who would have noticed that the founder", "of WhatsApp who became a billionaire from Facebook.", "[laughter]", "You heard me say chagrin right?", "You know, so I'm not active on a lot of social media,", "I do have a Twitter handle, I think it's--", "Yup, nope not even there.", "And so I think that it was more just", "to sort of say that I was participating in this movement,", "not necessarily as like oh god everyone.", "You know I think for everyone it's a personal choice.", "If you wanna be on Facebook and you wanna have ads", "thrust in front of you, go to town.", "I mean, that's your choice.", "There's lots of other choices on the internet.", "There's Signal, there's other choices.", "So one thing that happened", "after you left and it was in process I guess,", "one of the thing that was a issue", "when you were there is the idea", "of the business model of WhatsApp.", "You and Jan were very emphatic about", "being against the business model of advertising.", "And maybe we shouldn't even limit this to just to Facebook.", "Just in talking in general,", "do you think the business model", "of advertising is just by definition toxic,", "and has really hurt the whole community", "that's bound to the internet?", "You know toxics a strange word.", "Or sorry, a strong word.", "I think advertising has underwritten", "a lot of innovation in the world.", "So it's not necessarily fair to me", "to say that it's completely toxic.", "I think it's more fair to sort of", "evaluate it on it's own merits", "and to understand how advertising plays in", "in some of these corporations.", "Not famously but I worked at Yahoo!", "For 11 and a half years and as did Jan,", "he worked there for nine and a half years.", "And what we found was, is that the advertiser", "had a say in a lot, right.", "The advertiser could help dictate terms", "of what went on a page and what didn't go on a page.", "The advertiser could dictate terms of how,", "let's say take nudity for example.", "Advertisers don't like nudity,", "because they wanna cater to wholesome America.", "Whereas Europeans maybe don't care.", "So that's just one example among so many.", "Where advertisers sort of dictate", "and have a role in the relationship", "between the sort of, the service provider and the end user.", "And so it's kind of like this goofy", "three way handshake and it gets distorted.", "That's what happens, is fundamentally", "is that you lose the relationship", "and you have this third party sort of interference.", "And you know and like on Facebook newsfeed", "you can see it, the seventh item", "or the sixth item in your newsfeed is an ad.", "It's sponsored and it's like,", "I never asked for that I never wanted that", "it doesn't make the product any better for me.", "You're giving me kinda crufty yucky information.", "And some of this advertising has an affect on,", "and has an influence on me in some way.", "Maybe to buy a product or to vote for someone,", "it's undo influence.", "So I don't believe that advertising", "should be as strongly part of business models,", "and I think there should be more business model innovation", "in the internet in general.", "Well I guess the flip side of that", "and the answer is that by being a free service", "supported by advertising it goes out to everyone.", "And so if you charged for it,", "I know WhatsApp first charged you", "like a buck a year it didn't seem too onerous,", "but in order to do that it becomes more", "of a mass product that everyone can enjoy.", "You don't think that's a worthy trade off?", "A worthy trade off of charging the user?", "Or the free--", "[Steven] No well just getting it in the first place.", "Well I mean I think there's lots of ways", "of getting it in the first place", "without necessarily using ads.", "I mean, WhatsApp was free for the first year.", "We gave you an entire year to try out the product,", "use it don't use it, and it was your choice.", "I think there are lots of products", "that you could benefit from having that type of model.", "And that's just one of many explorations.", "The game ecosystem on mobile devices", "is rife with all these different", "variations of experiments of,", "can we get people to pay?", "They have their own problems but I think", "people should be still exploring other alternatives.", "Our clocks ticking down but I want to", "ask one more question, you've been around", "the internet since the very beginning", "of the explosion of the consumer internet in 1995.", "Now it's coming under criticism it's troubles.", "Are you still optimistic?", "I'm generally optimistic about technology in general.", "I think that the internet is one", "of the greatest innovations of mankind.", "And I think it will continue to drive innovation", "for the world at large.", "Well, thanks very much.", "[applause]"], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast"], "keywords": ["sort", "gonna", "encryption", "video",
