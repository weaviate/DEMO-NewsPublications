New York has begun trialing seven miles of \"open streets\" to ease crowding in parks, with Auckland Mexico City and Quito among the dozens of other world cities experimenting with similar measures.", "There are many purported benefits of \"reclaiming\" the streets during a pandemic. Encouraging cycling may reduce crowding on buses and subways, where people can struggle to get distance from one another. Vehicle-free roads also offer those without access to parks the ability to exercise safely.", "A woman cycles through a bike lane in central Milan.

Cities in the US, Canada and Australia have reconfigured traffic lights so that people no longer need to touch crosswalk buttons. (In any case, many pedestrian crossings are equipped with \" placebo buttons \" that have no impact on whether the lights go green).", "It is unclear if these urban interventions will continue once the pandemic is over. Milan plans to build 22 miles of new cycle lanes and permanently widen sidewalks after its lockdown lifts. Authorities in Hungary's capital, Budapest, have suggested that its new bike lanes may become permanent if the measures \"prove favorable,\" while planning officials in Providence, Rhode Island, have said crossings will now remain button-free", "But few other cities have been so committal. And it will be harder to make the case for pedestrian- and cycle-friendly streets once their benefits are weighed against the knock-on effects of congestion elsewhere -- especially in countries as dependent on cars as the US.", "Indeed, the cities in which pandemic-era measures seem most likely to stick are those already committed to change. Take Paris, for instance, where more than 400 miles of pop-up bike lanes (or \"coronapistes\") are set to open when France's national lockdown ends on May 11. Mayor Anne Hidalgo has called returning to a car-dominated status quo \"out of the question,\" but she was already backing a huge overhaul of biking in the city.", "A recently expanded bike track in Berlin's Kreuzberg district.

But urban planning is a long game in which change is piecemeal and the legacies of past decisions take time to overcome. Public spaces and amenities cannot always be expanded or reconfigured at will.", "So, looking to the coming years rather than the coming months, how else might the virus -- or attempts to prevent future ones -- re-shape our cities?", "Reimagining public space", "Parc de la Distance, a speculative proposal by Austrian design studio Precht, imagines a public park made from a maze-like network of three-foot-wide hedges. The layout provides 20-minute walking routes that can, in theory, be completed while maintaining distance from others, thanks to gates indicating when paths are occupied.", "Austrian design studio Precht has imagined a maze-like public park that encourages social distancing.", "Czech firm Hua Hua Architects has meanwhile proposed a \" Gastro Safe Zone \" (pictured top) which uses brightly colored ground markings to encourage passersby to keep their distance from al fresco diners.

But each idea suggests that the practice of social distancing and unease over shared surfaces could continue long after the current crisis.", "\u201c Planners talk about creating 'sticky' streets -- places where people linger and stay around.

Architects, whether designing parks or social housing, have often valued meeting points as sources of collaboration, inclusion and community-building.", "\"That contradiction is very interesting,\" said associate professor at the University of British Columbia, Jordi Honey-Ros\u00e9s, who co-authored one of the first academic studies into the potential impact of Covid-19 on public space.", "\"In fact, if you look at the literature on the health benefits of green spaces, one of the primary (advantages) is social connectivity -- people seeing their neighbors and being part of a community.", "\"Planners talk about creating 'sticky' streets -- places where people linger and stay around,\" he added, speaking on the phone from lockdown in Barcelona. \"So the question now is: Will those efforts continue, or how will they need to be changed?

Many relate to how cities manage the green spaces that he thinks \"will, overall, be more valued and more appreciated\" after the current crisis.", "In addition to their well-documented health and psychological benefits, greener cities may also be more resilient to future pandemics. A recent Harvard study has indicated a possible correlation between air pollution and the likelihood of dying from Covid-19 in the US, while Italian scientists have detected the virus on pollutant particles (and are looking at whether pollution may aid its spread).", "Neither line of inquiry has yielded conclusive results. But should a definitive link between pollution and the virus emerge, it would \"really be a game-changer\" for green urban planning, Honey-Ros\u00e9s said.", "\"Then, cities will be able to say, 'We're going to redesign our streets not only because we need social and physical distance, but because we need to increase our probability of survival,\" he suggested.", "A matter of density", "The biggest questions may center around population density.

Data from Harris Poll found that nearly a third of Americans are considering relocating to less crowded places as a direct result of Covid-19.

NYC must develop an immediate plan to reduce density.\"", "So will there be a long-term push for cities to sprawl outwards in order to reduce downtown populations?", "According to Carr, the backlash against city centers may be especially acute in America, where high rates of car ownership make suburban life less inconvenient. \"The United States has always been a country that somewhat fears density,\" she said.", "Credit: miss3/Hua Hua Architects", "A proposed \"Gastro Safe Zone,\" which uses brightly colored ground markings to encourage passersby to keep their distance from outdoor diners.

After all, density makes mass transit systems viable, improves access to public facilities (including hospitals) and promotes innovation and creativity.", "\"I think as designers and urban planners we have to think about how we emphasize the benefits of density,\" Carr added. \"Because now, whenever anyone tries to build new housing anywhere, it's probably going to be the first question that people have.\"", "Even before the development of germ theory, people have distrusted the benefits of living in close quarters. The Victorians' widespread belief that miasma (or \"bad air\") helped spread disease partly justified the clearance of London's 19th-century slums. During the 2003 SARS outbreak, the perils of density were seemingly laid bare when faulty plumbing saw the deadly virus sweep through Hong Kong's Amoy Gardens housing estate.", "\u201c Six feet could be the new unit we use when we think about cities and public parks. \u201d Sara Jensen Carr", "sparser cities in Europe and the US.

And while, again, the findings remain far from conclusive, mistrust of buses and subways may nonetheless see their use decline.", "Honey-Ros\u00e9s suggested we may instead see the growth of \"micromobility\" -- vehicles like scooters and e-bikes -- though this could be accompanied by reduced demand for initiatives like bike-sharing schemes.", "\"The sharing model is going to have additional costs related to hygiene and cleaning, which will be very challenging,\" he said, adding that sharing schemes \"might get hurt in this pandemic.\"", "A man rides an electric scooter across the Parco Sempione park in Milan.

Later that century, sanatoria built to treat tuberculosis came to inspire the white, clinical aesthetic of modernist architecture (while beliefs the disease could be remedied by sunlight influenced the movement's penchant for terraces and roof gardens, according to Carr).", "So although considering the impact of Covid-19 is, at this stage, largely speculative, there's plenty of scope for innovation.", "Perhaps we'll see the widespread adoption of automatic doors. Perhaps the popularity of urban farming in recent months will offer new relief from the threat of bare supermarket shelves.

Italian designer Umberto Menasci has envisaged a series of plexiglass boxes that allow beachgoers to relax in isolation. Elsewhere, this year's eVolo skyscraper design competition was won by a prefabricated emergency healthcare tower -- a concept dubbed \" Epidemic Babel \" -- that its Chinese designers claim could be rapidly erected in a future outbreak.", "Regardless of such proposals' viability, there is plenty of optimism that this crisis can improve the way cities are designed and run, said Honey-Ros\u00e9s.
