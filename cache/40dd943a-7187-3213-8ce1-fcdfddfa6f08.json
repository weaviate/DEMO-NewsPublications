How would the way fashion is made, and the way that we all interact with it, change in the face of urgent calls for racial equity, an ongoing climate crisis, and the devastating effects of a global pandemic? We divided the answers into five chapters, which we have titled Creating Fashion, Sustainable Fashion, Buying Fashion, Responsible Fashion, and Viewing Fashion. Taken together, they reveal a wide-ranging portrait of our time while also pointing the way forward\u2014to a different fashion calendar, a different protocol for production, and an altogether different relationship with clothes. Here, 30 models, designers, stylists and others weigh in on the future of Responsible Fashion.", "Ugbad Abdi, Model", "Brands should understand the importance of assembling a team that is diverse and inclusive, both in front of and behind the camera. I\u2019d like to see more thought being put into making models of color feel comfortable backstage, whether that\u2019s in terms of the hairstyling or in creating safe spaces in which models feel they can speak up and be heard. More and more, I\u2019m considering the brands I work with and whether their values align with my own. This is a moment in which we should all feel more empowered.", "Virgil Abloh, Designer, Off-White and Louis Vuitton (men)", "I\u2019m 39 years old, and it\u2019s taken 39 years to get here, to prove my pedigree. I\u2019m one of the few Black designers on the Parisian fashion calendar. There should be more Black design in the conversation, more of us showing on that schedule. Martine Rose, Samuel Ross, Grace Wales Bonner\u2014these are friends of mine, and I know their pedigree for design is just as impressive as my own, if not more. They should be filling up the Parisian houses. I\u2019m starting a scholarship under my name to put 100 Black kids into a wide range of historically Black colleges and accredited design schools in America\u2014a wide spectrum. It\u2019s not just inroads within the fashion industry that need attention\u2014it\u2019s like how I started, as a 17-year-old kid whose parents wanted him to be an engineer, and I said, \u201cNo\u2014I want to be a fashion designer.\u201d I mean, I started with a screen-printed T-shirt, and now I do what I do. It\u2019s like, how do you even get on that path?", "Adut Akech, Model", "If what\u2019s happening in America isn\u2019t a reality check and a wake-up call for a lot of people\u2014for so many problems, from racism and colorism in fashion, in acting, in any field\u2014I don\u2019t know what will be.", "Jason Bolden, Stylist", "It\u2019s a moment for a reset\u2014the clients and the hair and makeup people are all very careful who they partner with. They\u2019re looking at their values. Brands are being a bit more inclusive about dressing people, and the talent is very conscious as well\u2014 does it need to be a major house, or could it be an emerging designer?", "What I know for a fact\u2014and what I can help shift\u2014is that in order to be seen and heard, imagery is important. It makes us believe in hope and provides possibility. Once you discard images of Black people\u2014a designer, a director, a writer, a CEO, a board member, a celebrity\u2014that reality becomes less possible. Even without being told, you are being told that you don\u2019t belong. It\u2019s so simple: Every living person deserves an opportunity to live\u2014without fear, or caution, or PTSD. As a Black male, to be recognized by Vogue for the first time, it\u2019s a new step, a new journey. There are opportunities now\u2014the unheard voices are being heard. But also: Let\u2019s keep talking after this; talk to me about more than this.", "Andrew Bolton, Wendy Yu Curator in Charge, the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art", "What I\u2019ve been hearing from independent and younger designers is a greater emphasis on the ethics of fashion\u2014on conscious creativity and designing with intention; and on authenticity, craft, and artisanship. There\u2019s also a greater realization of the power of fashion as a tool for cultural commentary, for social justice and activism; for telling very political stories that include notions of diversity and inclusivity. I\u2019m not hearing as much about multiculturalism and transculturalism, which I wish I were, which would lead us into conversation about the decolonization of fashion. But certainly there\u2019s much more thought going into notions of nonbinary, gender-neutral clothing and notions of hybridity with seasonless, ageless, genderless collections and smaller productions. Something else I found really encouraging among the young designers I spoke to: There\u2019s no ambition to work for a big company or a large brand. They\u2019re more content creating a way of working that suits them and their customers and allows them more control over their own narratives.", "Tory Burch, Designer", "A purpose-led brand is so important: It\u2019s the reason I started my company. I was always interested in women\u2019s empowerment. How can we change the dynamic for women\u2014in the workforce, certainly, but beyond? Very simply: Fashion can make someone extremely confident. When we hear that when a woman wears something of ours and feels more confident\u2014that\u2019s a win for us. Fashion can change outlooks."], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "As Told To", "Jason Duzansk", "Rinaldi Parunga"], "keywords": ["akech", "virgil", "notions", "models", "mock", "responsible", "adut", "abloh", "im", "designers", "keeping", "way", "theres", "fashion", "know", "started", "black", "janet"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
