As the days and weeks melted into months, however, I came oddly to enjoy it, to find comfort in the four square blocks of empty streets and boarded-up stores. Was it my very own Stockholm syndrome? Was I the Patty Hearst of the New York lockdown?", "In the midst of it all I decided to embark on a closet edit\u2014by which I mean the creation of mountainous heaps of clothing left for weeks to gather dust and creases. In the process I came across an ensemble that I had completely forgotten: a wisteria-\u00adand-chartreuse steampunk biking lewk made for me by one Nan Eastep of B. Spoke Tailor. Absolutely lovely, but would I ever wear it?", "I hadn\u2019t really been on a bicycle since childhood, when I learned to ride on a borrowed Chopper with handlebars high as those of a motorbike. In the years to follow, my trusty three-gear secondhand Raleigh proved a godsend. I secured my trouser legs with bicycle clips to prevent them from snagging in the oily chain and set off, with a sandwich and an apple in the front basket, and butcher\u2019s paper and crayons strapped on to the metal shelf over the back wheel, to barrel down and strain up the Kentish hills, to ancient, isolated churches thither to capture the fanciful likenesses of long-faced Medieval knights in pointy shoes, and their long-faced brides in escoffions and houpelandes, praying that I wouldn\u2019t get a puncture.", "Several years back, pushed to it by friends, I availed myself of a V\u00e9lib in Paris one evening but was so busy gawping at the fascinating window treatments and boiseries of upper floor apartments that I went the wrong way up several sens unique streets and smacked into the back of a stationary truck. Thusly chastened I decided that a Citibike probably wasn\u2019t for me.
