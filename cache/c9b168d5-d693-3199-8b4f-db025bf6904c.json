Lhaga Koondhor (aka Asian Eyez), Amber Akilla, and Daliah Spiegel began the project last year by offering deejaying lessons to femme, non-binary, and LGBTQ+ people in the local electronic music scene. But beyond that, they hoped to provide these marginalized individuals\u2014among them, emerging producers, DJs, and artists\u2014a gathering place in the city.", "Daliah Spiegel, Amber Akilla, and Lhaga Koondhor Photo: Mathilde Agius / Courtesy of Red Bull Media House", "Although this class of DJ workshop has become increasingly prevalent in the West, in Shanghai, NVSHU is the first of its kind.

In their eyes, NVSHU is more of a loose network of instructors and participants with similar values organized over social media rather than \u201ca closed members club,\u201d Koondhor says.", "NVSHU offers lessons in both English and Mandarin, and while its founders are English speakers, they are careful of imposing their native language onto local students and extend that sensitivity to every corner of what they do. As an expatriate, Akilla is acutely aware of the limits of trying to transfer Western ideas of feminism to Shanghai; the goal of NVSHU is to empower marginalized individuals through music education, but they are also wary of engaging in overtly political discussions with their students. \u201cI can\u2019t tell a woman who is growing up here how she should perceive her sexuality or her gender identity,\u201d Akilla says. \u201cThat\u2019s a form of colonization.
