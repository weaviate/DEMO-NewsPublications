She writes that she was dismissed in some quarters as looking like an otherworldly alien, \u201cbut I\u2019d never felt more seen, more beautiful, and more wholly myself.\u2026 When the magazine came out\u2014with me on the cover\u2014my career skyrocketed, but I was also viewed by some as a circus sideshow freak.\u201d", "Elson\u2019s unconventional fairy-tale punk-princess allure is perhaps one reason she is particularly sensitive to the ways in which outmoded standards of beauty have to change. And she is hopeful that the welcome shift in our current political discourse\u2014a resurgent feminism; the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements\u2014will allow young women working in the fashion industry today to feel empowered, to find their voices. In the past, asking too many questions, sticking up for yourself, might get you labeled as a troublemaker or even cost you jobs. \u201cPeople love it when you are partying all night\u2014and the crazier you are, the more they love it,\u201d she says. \u201cBut be a good businesswoman? No.\u201d Still, she remains optimistic. \u201cI think, finally, the tables are turning. It\u2019s really all about who gets a seat at the table. The spectrum of beauty is so varied in the normal world, and a willowy white woman is just one person on that spectrum.\u201d", "Nashville earlier this year.", "Elson is fighting not just for more room at the table but for a unified code of conduct\u2014one that mandates a workplace that isn\u2019t toxic, that does not tolerate sexually inappropriate behavior or permit problematic language on set. \u201cAgencies need training, casting directors need training\u2014we need training sessions before Fashion Week. We need to show people what a safe working environment looks like.\u201d", "Oddly enough, the way the COVID pandemic has forced us to reexamine what is really important has served to bolster Elson\u2019s conviction that the fashion business can transform itself. \u201cEverything that has happened recently has made people realize how unsustainable the industry was becoming\u2014with so many collections, we were veering toward a collective burnout. We all felt like we were running too fast to appreciate our lives, and this tragedy has made us all slow down. Coming out of this, if we can hold on to our sense of decency and to a bigger sense of community, we can carry that care into how we approach our business.\u201d"], "authors": ["Lynn Yaeger", "Lynn Yaege"], "keywords": ["lives", "need", "revisits", "industry", "iconic", "lowsof", "red", "elson", "love", "table", "highsand", "karen", "working", "sense", "flame", "fashion", "training", "really", "high"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
