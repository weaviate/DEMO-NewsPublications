The spell is cast shortly before dusk, when the city seems to glow as swallows dart and sing in the darkening sky. Yet tonight, from my position on a rooftop overlooking the Piazza del Duomo, a new magic\u2014a kind of human alchemy\u2014is afoot in Lecce. In the square below, Dior is holding its cruise 2021 show. This marks both a significant departure\u2014the house has never before shown in Italy\u2014and a significant homecoming: Antonio, the father of Dior\u2019s creative director, Maria Grazia Chiuri, was born right here in Puglia. \u201cFor me,\u201d she says, \u201cto be here is to come back to my memories of the summers I spent here when I was young. I still spend a lot of time here and have a family house here, but I had never reflected on how the culture of this land influences me and how I work in fashion.\u201d", "How Chiuri works in fashion, in fact, is what has brought her home to further her transformative journey for Dior. Ever since her appointment in 2016 as the first female designer of this legendary Paris womenswear maison, she has worked to widen its aperture\u2014and to make the brand relevant to a greater audience than ever before\u2014by welcoming a progressive and inclusive cast of collaborators to help shape her authorship. we should all be feminists was her opening statement in 2016\u2014via Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\u2014emblazoned across T-shirts on the runway. Further voices contributing to Chiuri\u2019s chorales have included those of legendary art historian Linda Nochlin (why have there been no great women artists? on another T-shirt) and artist Judy Chicago (who created a towering installation for Dior\u2019s spring 2020 haute couture show). She has also welcomed contributions from the Chanakya School of Craft in Mumbai to realize the set for that same Chicago-inspired couture show, and both Grace Wales Bonner and the artist Mickalene Thomas designed Bar jackets for last year\u2019s sensational cruise show in Marrakech.
