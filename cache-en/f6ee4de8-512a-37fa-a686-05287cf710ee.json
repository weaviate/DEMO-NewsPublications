Architectural Digest, 2014.", "Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana,", "Designers", "When most people think map, they think Google. Then there are still some others who think needle and thread, including Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce. Who of us isn\u2019t aware that their clothes bear the legend made in italy\u2014but their cartographical sweep goes far beyond Milan (their HQ) or Sicily (their spiritual home). Dolce and Gabbana chart the land by highlighting the artisans: the weavers and embroiderers, the tailors and the jewelers. In early September, the red location pin landed on Florence, where the duo worked with 38 of the city\u2019s botteghe to inspire and create their couture collections. It was in part a tribute to Florence\u2019s Alta Moda beginnings, in 1951, when entrepreneur Giovanni Giorgini showcased Florentine couturiers, but also a jump back in time to the splendors of the Renaissance. \u201cAfter the Second World War, that Alta Moda moment helped create a new kind of rebirth for Italy through fashion,\u201d Gabbana said recently. To a country that saw the worst of COVID-19 early on in the pandemic, their Florence collections are their own act of defiance against the rage of recent history\u2014the belief in tomorrow bolstered by the techniques of yesteryear. It\u2019s part of this duo\u2019s belief that fashion is but one expression of the relationship between craft, creativity, and community. Those 38 botteghe Dolce and Gabbana celebrated included glassmakers, woodworkers, goldsmiths. \u201cItaly is based on artisanship, not only in fashion but in food, wine\u2014all aspects of culture,\u201d Dolce said just after their Florence shows. \u201cEvery season we take Alta Moda to a new part of the country, and we go deeper and learn more about our culture.\u201d\u2014M.H."], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Alex Harringto", "Tonne Goodma"], "keywords": ["early", "names", "alta", "dolce", "store", "gabbana", "courtesy", "household", "talenton", "19", "emerging", "florence", "moda", "fashion", "designersfrom", "partnership", "think", "power"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
