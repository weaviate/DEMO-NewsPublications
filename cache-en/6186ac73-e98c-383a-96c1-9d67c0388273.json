most important years.", "Zero to five.", "A 19 year study reveals kindergarten students", "with these two skills are twice as likely", "to obtain a college degree.", "These two skills.", "So in my last talk, which was two nights ago,", "I asked people what did they think those two skills were?", "And actually they thought, the answers were", "really interesting, but none of them", "hit the nail on the head.", "So you should just ask yourself,", "what do you think those two skills are?", "It turns out they're social emotional skills.", "Not only that, they're the most important skills", "that people that are hiring look for in their employees,", "prospective employees.", "So we should be focusing on social emotional learning", "in schools, and we're still focusing on testing.", "So 85% of the brain is developed before the age of five.", "85% and habits are developed early, really early.", "So what we need to do is to trust your child.", "If they feel like they're trusted,", "and they

room with that staff member.", "Advisor wouldn't be present.", "I think like we definitely, we have another advisor, Sat,", "but we definitely go to them for advise,", "but it's never a oh you have to

"after robbing like a nearby bank.", "And there was a police chase on campus.", "And we each completely took initiative", "and covered that story,", "and we got that out with like police information,", "admin interviews, and student interviews", "six hours before our local news,", "like professional news organization did.", "And Sat and Woj are huge advocates for us", "like taking that initiative and going out there.", "And also we had like conflict with admin.", "But Sat and Woj about letting us cover that story,", "since there were police present on campus.", "It was very hectic, but yeah.", "How many times did I read the story and correct it?", "[Lucy] Zero.", "[laughing]", "Zero times.", "Why, because I trust them.", "And I think that makes a huge difference", "to feeling good about yourselves and trusting it.", "And this newspaper goes out to 5,000 families", "in Palo Alto, and it's online for thousands of people.", "So this is real trust.", "[Freida] Sorry, I was just going to add on and say,", "like another part of it, was so we interviewed", "some administrators about it.", "And I would really touch on like", "the taking initiative aspect.", "So when we were talking to this administrator,", "he was giving us all this information", "that was like yeah, this all happened in the span of", "like two minutes and like we were really upset about it.", "And we ended up taking a stance on it for an editorial,", "but for our news story we were talking", "to this administrator.", "And he was giving us this information,", "and I was saying, no that's not true.", "Because right as it started happening,", "we had raced over, started taking photos,", "like taking interviews and all of that.", "I guess going back to what Woj was saying,", "like no one's going to teach you to chase after the police", "that are on our campus to go take photos.", "And no one's going to teach you to reach out", "to your administrator and like basically harass them", "until they give you an interview.", "Like that's something that you learn on your own,", "and like the trust is really important to that.", "They would never have done that", "if they didn't believe in themselves.", "And that's what trust gives you,", "belief in yourself and grit.", "Which is what everybody wants kids to have today.", "I'm really glad you're teaching the next generation", "of
