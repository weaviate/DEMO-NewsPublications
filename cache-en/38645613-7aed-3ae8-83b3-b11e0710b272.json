Coming from her, this assertion is a bit rich\u2014and Schreck knows it, laughing at her own words. We\u2019re meeting at a cafe\u0301 near Manhattan\u2019s Helen Hayes Theater, where her extraordinary play, What the Constitution Means to Me, has been holding audiences rapt, both a critical and word-of-mouth hit.", "Over the last two-plus years\u2014not uncoincidentally the span of the 45th presidency\u2014the show has migrated from a tiny downtown theater to California\u2019s Berkeley Rep to Broadway, with the latest production earning Schreck an Obie award for Best New American Play and two Tony Award nominations. As boisterous and open-hearted offstage as she is on, Schreck can\u2019t suppress a watery reddening of her eyes as she considers the impact that her show has had. \u201cI get a lot of women who come back a second or third time and bring their daughters or mothers,\u201d she says. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be getting whole families!\u201d", "A de facto one-woman production, with only a couple of strategically timed walk-ons by other performers, it finds Schreck doing aloud what many of us have, of late, been doing in the privacy of our own minds: questioning the bedrock assumptions that we have long held dear about the United States of America. In the play, the 47-year-old Schreck reconsiders her childhood as an oratorical prodigy from Wenatchee, Washington, who won speaking competitions by exalting the U.S. Constitution. On a set decorated to resemble the wood-paneled American Legion halls in which she competed as a youth, Schreck comes to the conclusion that her teenage crush\u2014the 1787 document\u2014maybe isn\u2019t so dreamy after all. Drawing upon raw personal history, she details how her own family has been affected by the institutional biases against women that the Constitution helped perpetuate.", "What the Constitution Means to Me is an audacious piece of art that somehow goes down easily\u2014a testament to Schreck\u2019s offbeat candor. Much of the play, surprisingly, was written before the 2016 presidential election. \u201cTo me,\u201d says Schreck, \u201cthat speaks to the fact that what\u2019s happening now\"\u2014the post-Obama backslide into patriarchal illiberalism\u2014\u201cis not necessarily an aberration. I do think, though, that the moment we\u2019re in made the play more necessary.\u201d Tellingly, among those who have come to see the show are Hillary Clinton and Ruth Bader Ginsburg."], "authors": ["David Kamp", "David Kam"], "keywords": ["meaning", "constitution", "giving", "play", "piece", "political", "times", "means", "heidi", "schreck", "women", "production", "theater", "art"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
