I know it could take months for it to be distributed and for things to truly return back to normal, but I\u2019m filled with unbridled optimism, which is why I\u2019m fantasy-shopping for the best travel accessories.", "Since worry-free traveling is only a dream for now, all of my recent purchases are still rooted in practicality\u2014like a cozy jacket for chilly airplane rides versus an itsy-bitsy bikini that I couldn\u2019t use this winter in New York City. This past Monday, I preordered the big Telfar x Ugg bag (without a doubt, it\u2019s going to sell out). Sadly, the coveted bag won\u2019t ship until sometime between next March and June, but it\u2019ll become my new go-to tote once it arrives. And as soon as it\u2019s safe to do so, I\u2019ll be dashing through some airline\u2019s terminal with the shearling-trimmed tote on my arm. I also have my eyes peeled for a luxe carry-on, especially since so many sales are going strong until the end of the week. If you too are longing for the return of carefree traveling, then perhaps it\u2019s time to treat yourself to some of the best travel accessories in preparation for better days.", "Ahead, you\u2019ll find everything you need to travel in style, of course, once it\u2019s safe again.
