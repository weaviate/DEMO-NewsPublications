probably,I don't know if you are aware or not.\nI don't know that that's,I don't know that we want to do that.\nBut that's that's an interesting way to explore it.\nIt is a performance, it is what you do performativelyto let the rest of the world know how you function.\nI want, I don't know, human beingswho are gonna build hydrofoils or whatever, I don't know.", "paragraphs": ["Transcript", "[upbeat music]", "Hi, how are you guys?", "Thank you, thank you for the welcome, thank you Jason.", "So we're gonna start talking about world building.", "And yes, this is super basic world building.", "I am making the assumption that the majority", "of the people here in the audience are not writers.", "We're gonna go through different pieces of how this works.", "The world building workshop that I do", "is normally oriented towards writers.", "But I have given this workshop to 12 year olds,", "that was tough, to high schoolers, to college students,", "to MFAA program students, and so on.", "You are the third techy audience that I have given this to.", "So we're gonna see how this goes.", "But it's a workshop, it's gonna be interactive.", "There will be points where I ask people", "to come up and contribute to this.", "We're gonna create a shared world", "over the course of this workshop.", "And I want to tell you now you can use this world", "if you want, I am not gonna take it from you.", "I'm not gonna go off and write a book in your world,", "I might, but if I do, if everybody in this room", "writes something in the same world", "it's gonna be a different execution.", "So that's what matters.", "So basically this is what we're gonna be covering today.", "I will tell you a little bit about", "why we're gonna be doing this.", "And then I'll show you a variation on the workshop", "that hopefully you'll find interesting.", "There will be time for Q and A at the end.", "But you can't interrupt me.", "The problem is that with the lights", "it's a little difficult for me to see hands.", "So if you have a really urgent question, you're gonna have", "to actually call out to make sure that I see you.", "All right so, the reason why I do this workshop", "is because the fiction that we absorb has", "an impact on the reality that we tend to perceive.", "So just as a general example, most of you", "will probably know this, but I get different", "answers when I ask this question, why do seasons exist?", "Anybody want to answer, I will call on people.", "To make the world interesting is a very literary answer.", "It's a trap, I love it.", "Do we have, yes would you like to, I can see you okay.", "[Student] Varies with the amount of sunlight", "the Earth gets over, during it's rotation around the Sun.", "Okay what causes the variation?", "[Student] The tilt and distance of the Earth from the Sun.", "The distance of the Earth from the Sun, and the tilt?", "That's actually incorrect, no offense.", "So here's the thing.", "Back in the 1940s and '50s a lot of science fiction writers", "basically suggested what you said that the Earth", "moves farther away or gets closer to the Sun.", "And that this is what causes the change of seasons,", "of course that the planet is tilted,", "and so the sunlight is hitting this side", "when we're on this side of the Sun and so forth.", "But what's actually happening is that", "the Earth's rotation is almost circular.", "And what they were describing was an elliptical rotation,", "I'm sorry, revolution, revolution around the sun,", "yes revolution, what they were describing", "was an almost elliptical revolution in which the Earth", "got closer or farther from the Sun.", "But no, the Earth stays at almost the same", "distance from the Sun all the way around.", "This was false information that was being", "spread by science fiction writers.", "And it's about science, we're supposed to care", "about science, but we were screwing up the science.", "So it's kind of important that we not do that.", "So we try, going forward, to make sure that", "even though we're telling stories about fiction,", "even though this is, in my case fantasy,", "we try and make sure that we're getting", "the basic facts of how science, and the world,", "and people work, we want to try and make sure", "that we're getting that right.", "All right so, a couple of examples of ways", "in which fiction tend to inform reality.", "Well, two very serious examples.", "I'll let you read.", "But most of you are familiar with the Michael Brown", "situation which caused the the protests in Ferguson,", "the appearance of tanks and army vehicles", "on a regular street, regular city street.", "And the man who killed Michael Brown,", "regardless of what you've heard about the whole situation.", "What facts are relevant are that he was unarmed,", "he was 21 feet away from Wilson,", "when the bulk of the bullets hit him.", "And he was in fact not a superhuman monster.", "He was just an 18 year old.", "So his, the policeman's basically", "perception of Michael Brown of someone superhuman,", "as someone stronger or bigger than a human being,", "unstoppable by just one bullet made a difference.", "He might have survived one bullet, he didn't survive 11.", "And another example, we've heard in a lot of cases of", "women who experience chronic pain, or specific pain,", "going through their doctors and just simply", "not being believed, being told that their pain", "is just in their mind, being told that it's not real.", "And it's partly because in a lot of cases,", "doctors just seem to assume that women exaggerate pain,", "that it's not real, and this makes a huge difference.", "Because half of our population basically is struggling", "to get complete medical care, and that's compounded", "by intersections of if these are women", "of color, poor women, and so on.", "So I think you can probably think of examples of myths", "that outweigh the facts in everyday life.", "I am a giant fan of Ta-Nehisi Coates,", "I have not read his latest book, soon, busy.", "But I love this quote from him.", "The history breaks the myth, and so the history is ignored", "in fictions are weaved into our art and politics,", "that dress villainy in martyrdom,", "and transform banditry into chivalry.", "So this is why I quoted this, we are historically", "a society that's preferred myth to reality.", "How many of you are watching Watchmen on HBO?", "Two hands, three, wow all right.", "It's a good show, you should check it out.", "I don't, and I say that like very very cautiously.", "I don't like watching TV, TV is too slow and non-interactive", "for me, it's not as exciting as a book.", "So I have to just sit there and let somebody else tell me", "the story, I'm like can't this go faster, page faster.", "But I've actually, I've only watched the first two episodes", "of Watchmen, and I'm really really enjoying it.", "But after the first episode of Watchmen,", "there was a little bit of a public outcry, and freak out.", "Because the first episode depicted a real", "historical event, which was the bombing of", "a black neighborhood in Tulsa, Oklahoma.", "And apparently a whole lot of people", "didn't learn about that in school,", "And a lot of people were like oh wait wait, that was real?", "That actually happened?", "Yeah, it happened.", "And so we've been having a little bit", "of a national conversation lately about", "the fact that there's a whole lot of history", "about our country that we don't know.", "And our lack of knowledge about this is dictating,", "in a lot of cases, our policies, our understandings,", "our attitudes towards whole groups of people.", "And we should maybe watch that, maybe.", "All right so another question for you.", "The white supremacist alt right got its start", "by attacking video gaming, comic books,", "popular films, and science fiction fantasy.", "I was surprised by this, and many of you are probably,", "I don't know if you are aware or not.", "I ended up dealing with a little bit of flack from", "a white supremacist that I happened to annoy,", "basically by existing, and so I had to deal with", "some death threats, some rape threats, fun things like that.", "And so this is a thing that happened in science fiction.", "Those Hugo's that I won, yeah woo, those Hugo's that I won.", "[audience applauding] [laughing]", "I wasn't actually soliciting.", "But all right, thank you I'll take it.", "But those Hugo's that I won actually happened to come", "at a time when, for whatever reason,", "the branch of the alt right that existed", "in science fictiondom, decided that it was going", "to try and take over the Hugo Awards.", "And so they basically got Gamergate to come", "and help them out, and the whole bunch, like it was weird.", "And then they rigged the nominations,", "and put only their own, well not only,", "they put their own preferred writers into each category.", "And there was a whole big fru-fra about it,", "you can read about it if you want.", "But what the final result was,", "that the science fiction audience rejected them,", "basically voted them no award repeatedly.", "And so they were pushed back, at least in that venue.", "But why is this group that later went on to form", "the backbone of president Trump's more", "vocal support system, why did this group start", "by attacking Star Wars, or video games?", "I mean this seems like such a trivial area to me anyway.", "It's a trivial area.", "I don't mind making money from it.", "But at the end of the day, what I do", "is meant to be fun storytelling.", "So why on Earth are we being attacked by like", "Russian bot campaigns and everything else over this?", "I see a hand sort of in the middle there, yes?", "[Student] Hi, I think it's because when", "they attack some things that people care", "so deeply about it raises their voices in a way", "that they feel has been heard for.", "One example would be the whole Martin Scorsese,", "Marvel situation, a lot of people were feeling", "attacked by the Martin Scorsese set--", "Everybody's mad at him right now. [laughing]", "[Student] It was like, that thing is seemingly trivial.", "But there was so many discords around it,", "better than others, but it raises conversation.", "So I feel like when you attack things", "that people enjoy, it automatically raises,", "kind of like ups their trending status.", "Ups their trending status, okay, I like that phrase.", "I think that's definitely one of the reasons.", "You get people riled up because it's something that", "they love, and you're attacking something that they love,", "or you're telling them that something that they love", "is attacking them, and so people react to that.", "My feeling though is that, world building", "and fiction is about creating myths.", "Once you see how it works in fiction,", "you realize it's the same process in society.", "And so if you're trying to understand", "how to manipulate a society, learning how", "to retell its myths, break its myths,", "change its myths, is really the way to do that.", "And so it's a thing that I think a lot of creators", "innately realize, but not a lot of people", "outside of the creative spaces understand,", "that at the end of the day fiction is really about reality.", "And it's one of the ways that we manipulate reality,", "the zeitgeist, so that's what I feel like.", "I'm sure that a lot of you are aware", "of things like the power of spin.", "Spin is just a more subtle version of world building.", "It's just that it's 2019, and the spin isn't subtle anymore.", "We're gonna move now into a new phase.", "Yes, I get so much flak over the Hamilton quote, anyway.", "It's still great.", "We're gonna talk about something", "extremely important right now.", "I think it's really crucial for you to hear about this.", "How many of you are familiar with this character,", "and the game that he comes from?", "Only a few hands, so sad, all right.", "Well, I'm going to tell you all about him.", "So this is the main character of the game", "Mass Effect, his name is Commander Shepard.", "Mass Effect is the stirring saga,", "for those of you that don't play video games, sadly.", "The stirring saga of an ordinary soldier", "who discovers a vast alien conspiracy", "to wipe out every civilization in the galaxy.", "He must then lead a team of the best", "and brightest to hopefully defeat it.", "So when, I'm gonna show you the first ad here.", "When Mass Effect first came out, this is how,", "the first game, this is how they advertises it.", "I think this was back in 2007,", "so it's gonna be a little dated.", "No, do I, no.", "[speaking in foreign language]", "[dramatic music]", "[Noveria] Trinity, do you copy?", "We're under attack.", "[Computer System] Incoming transmission from Noveria.", "[Noveria] Trinity, are you there?", "Repeat, requesting immediate aide, please, please.", "[Computer System] Request denied.", "Setting new course for Gellix 10.", "[dramatic music]", "[Shepard] Many decisions lie ahead,", "none of them easy.", "[Announcer] Rated M for Mature.", "These are great speakers, all right.", "That was the first ad, for the first game.", "Now I will tell all of you, personal disclosure,", "I eventually ended up writing a media tie in novel", "for Mass Effect, for Mass Effect Andromeda.", "So clearly my attitude about this game now is", "very different from my attitude back in 2007", "when I first saw that commercial.", "The reason that I did not like this game,", "when I first saw that commercial, had no interest in it.", "I started playing Mass Effect when the third game", "of the series came out, ignored the first two, why?", "All games are about decision making.", "If the correct decision is to do nothing,", "there's absolutely no reason for me to feel invested", "in this character or his choices.", "I look for characters that are not the standard", "brown haired, grizzled, white dude, middle age, yada yada.", "And the the first one that I saw,", "that I might have identified with,", "and I can identify with white dudes.", "All of us who were not white dudes, learn that we have to.", "[audience laughing]", "But it would be nice to occasionally identify", "with the woman, but there's only one woman in that trailer.", "And she's in the background.", "And she seems to have no emotions,", "or even less of a heart than he does.", "He at least looks sad.", "She's just like, let them people die.", "The most emotive character is the giant space chicken.", "Who I later romanced, anyway.", "He's a wonderful character, anyway.", "But so the most relatable character", "in that whole trailer was the giant space chicken.", "But it was clear that he also was not treated as important,", "his agency was also not important to the game.", "So my conclusion was this is boring, why would I watch this?", "But Mass Effect is also, oh sorry, skipped ahead.", "Okay quick, five, four, find the Mass Effect protagonist.", "Five, four, three, two, one, anybody find him?", "These are all the protagonists of", "Triple A video games released in that year.", "Same year.", "So, no he did not stand out, let's just say.", "But this is also Mass Effect.", "They didn't advertise this until the third game came out.", "And they only advertised it in a Facebook campaign", "to decide who would go on the cover of the third game.", "Fem Shep as people call her,", "or M Shep as people call the male version.", "So that was the first time, when I saw that Facebook", "campaign, that was the first time I even realized", "you could play as a woman in this game.", "This was my particular Fem Shep.", "I didn't know you could change the characters race.", "That was kind of important for me to know.", "So this is my, this is not fan art specifically", "of my character, but mine ended up looking a lot like her.", "So this is Jocasta Shepard.", "She grew up on the streets, joined the military to survive,", "took no shit from anybody, and she eventually", "fell in love with an alien space velociraptor.", "And if I had known from the beginning that I could do this,", "I would have been on this game like white on rice,", "like in a heartbeat, seriously.", "The simple change, a single change from male to female", "meant that your character might not be straight,", "because you could have a queer romance,", "granted with an alien, you could have a queer romance", "if you were playing as Fem Shep, you could not as M Shep.", "M Shep was strictly no homo for the first two games.", "They finally let him get some, well sorry,", "get some queerishly in game three.", "But for the first two games he", "could only look and longingly sigh.", "But in the first game you could.", "You could date a woman, or a female alien.", "Your character ran like a soldier,", "like actual heavy stride and so forth, instead of the", "that was so typical of games back then.", "Because the devs are too cheap", "to create animations for women.", "It worked out, that was good, she actually", "looked like a soldier, it was nice.", "In the Mass Effect verse, sexism supposedly no longer exists", "but you could be sexually harassed", "if you played as Fem Shep.", "Now this is not a benefit, I don't necessarily", "want to enjoy sexual harassment in my entertainment.", "But it made the world feel more realistic.", "Because the horseshit that I was hearing", "from the characters, about sexual harassment", "and all these things don't exist anymore,", "was being bolide by the reality.", "And that felt just like the real world.", "So yeah, that was a possibility.", "Your character could have three different", "love interests throughout the series,", "which simply meant that your character could be,", "well not sort of polyamorous, it was serially.", "But your character could have a like complete sex life,", "that was not a thing that you saw very often in games,", "especially not for women characters.", "So it was possible for your character to be", "brown, queer, disabled, and a slut with", "lots of reasons to tell the galaxy to fuck off.", "The disabled part is that the game has", "a kind of created disabilities.", "Basically you have the ability to do space magic,", "but it's because of basically radiation poisoning.", "And you have to use a special implant", "to be able to use the space magic,", "which causes a lot of side effects,", "and effectively is a disability, so anyway, because of this,", "these are some other alternate ways of seeing Mass Effect.", "I'll let you read.", "Oh I don't have a laser pointer, all right.", "I'll have to use my hand.", "So you could have your character be a lot more angry.", "You could, that changed the whole tone of the story.", "You could have your character be someone who", "is keenly aware of her various oppressions,", "and has no particular reason to support the existing system.", "So there's a whole lot of variation that exists in this game", "if you simply change few very minor parameters of the game.", "These are equally interesting stories, and probably more", "interesting than the one that was advertised, surely to me", "more interesting than the one that was advertised.", "So I don't know why they didn't", "advertise these possibilities.", "They did eventually get around to it, but not at first.", "These were part of the narrative,", "but they didn't want anybody to know for some reason.", "So shoehorn politics, Gamergaters", "went after game three in particular.", "And so their complaint was that the politics were", "shoehorned in, but at the end of the day", "politics is anything about people.", "Almost anything where you're writing about", "human beings has politics embedded in it.", "It's just a question of whether your politics", "are those of ordinary people, or whether your politics", "are those of the just simply the brown haired,", "grizzled, middle aged white dudes in the audience.", "And it seemed like that was the only politics", "that they were particularly interested in.", "So Bioware decided that they wanted to advertise", "the brown haired, grizzled, white dude politics,", "and nothing else, which was a little sad.", "It's a low risk choice, it meant that they did not piss off", "the brown haired, grizzled, white dude audience,", "or at least not at first, but it meant that people", "like me were not particularly drawn into this.", "So when they decided to start advertising", "the simple fact that you could play as Fem Shep.", "They didn't advertise the racial variations,", "they didn't advertise any of that, any of the fact", "that you could for example date a queer person,", "date as a queer person, or any of that.", "Once they started advertising that you could", "just simply be a woman, something happened.", "So higher risk choices,", "they perceive that as a higher risk choice.", "You know I probably shouldn't touch those,", "I'm sorry, to the AV people.", "But so they perceived advertising this", "beyond the grizzled, white haired contingent.", "I'm sorry grizzled, brown haired, white dude contingent.", "They perceive that as a higher risk choice.", "However, they got a substantially higher reward", "by actually leaning into them.", "And those changes actually helped to open the door", "for more people to enjoy the industry.", "This is one of the reasons why I'm a giant raging gamer now.", "So stories matter, stories impact reality,", "understanding stories helps with understanding reality.", "Good stories of riskier people are inherently different,", "and in my opinion, more interesting.", "Or at least if nothing else they're stories", "that you have not seen quite as much.", "And telling these stories realistically", "helps the bottom line.", "So this isn't just an argument for for diversity.", "This is an argument actually for decolonization.", "This is an argument for making sure that you are building in", "from the ground up an understanding", "of how human beings work, and a willingness to include", "all human beings in your story, basically from jump,", "rather than as a last minute afterthought.", "And that's what this workshop is about.", "So we're gonna move into the workshop portion of it now.", "Would anyone like to take a five minute break, however?", "Are we seeing hands for a break.", "No, want to keep going?", "All right, we can do that, no I'm good.", "I've had coffee, my life is complete.", "All right so we will proceed.", "So normally I teach this workshop in two", "one hour sessions to aspiring pro writers.", "First we talk about something called macro world building.", "Macro world building is about the world itself,", "the physical environment of the world.", "Micro world building, the second component of it,", "is about the people who will inhabit that world,", "the culture, their power dynamics.", "And then later on I usually do a third workshop on character", "where we pick who our protagonists will be.", "We're not gonna go into all that because you guys aren't", "writing novels, or you probably aren't writing novels.", "Okay, raise your hand if you're writing a novel.", "Whoa whoops, more of you writing", "novels than playing Mass Effect.", "[audience laughing]", "It's fine, anyway.", "Okay well, I apologize for assuming", "not everyone in here would be interested.", "But we're gonna try and focus on micro world building", "for this session just because that's the part", "that tends to be the most interesting.", "But you'll get at least a taste of the macro world building.", "So we're gonna do a truncated version of this workshop now.", "This is macro world building.", "Macro world building, usually I start with", "the planet for the sake of time in the workshop.", "But you can actually start with like the laws of physics.", "You can start with the creation at", "the level of the universe basically,", "or the macro-verse if you want to go that hard.", "So it's just a question of how much theoretical", "physics you really want to get into,", "because you do have to get all of this stuff right.", "So if you really are super interested in playing with say,", "a universe where one plus one equals three,", "and you're able to imagine that, go for it.", "I'd be interested to read it.", "So for the sake of the workshop I usually start with", "the planet level though, and then we're gonna", "add continents, ecology, all of that.", "So we're actually gonna start doing this at this point.", "I would like a volunteer.", "[laughing]", "Ooh, y'all is suspicious, to come up and to draw.", "I'm gonna draw a circle on here.", "And I want one of you to come up", "and put continents onto this circle.", "Would you like to come up?", "I think I saw your hand first.", "This is gonna be,", "we'll do just one hemisphere of the planet.", "We'll assume the other hemisphere is okay.", "Yes, please choose, or please write in,", "continents in whatever form that you want.", "However, hold on a second.", "So we're gonna assume for the sake of this exercise", "an Earth like solar system, so we're gonna have", "a single yellow Sun, no double Suns, this ain't Tatooine.", "We're gonna do the Sun is in a Goldilocks zone.", "No surprise black holes, none of that.", "We will assume a terrestrial planet with water.", "We can do gas giants, it's just that that gets complicated.", "One moon, multiple moons, is the planet a moon?", "We can talk about that.", "We're also going to, when we insert continents,", "your continents should kind of", "fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.", "So draw whatever continents you like.", "While she is doing that, so do we have a moon?", "One moon, two moons, no moons, three moons?", "Can we get a moon? [mimics an auctioneer]", "Two moons, three moons. [mimics an auctioneer]", "Two moons, three more more moons, no okay.", "Six moons, we got a lot of moons.", "All right I'm sorry, I'm being silly.", "Was that a three?", "I will go with three.", "All right so we have three moons around this planet.", "Now we're not going to get into the physics", "of orbital dynamics, or orbital mechanics.", "However, if you are going to do this", "as a writer you actually should.", "One of the inspirations,", "that's kind of a spoiler though.", "All right well, I was just gonna say that", "one of the inspirations for a book that I wrote", "was having a great discussion with some other writers", "at a NASA workshop that I did a few years ago,", "about what would happen if the Earth lost its moon.", "So anyway, all right so how are we doing on our continents?", "What do they look like?", "Not jaggedy enough?", "You know that'll do, that'll do, all right, okay.", "Thank you very much, so that's, oh yes thank you.", "So those are our continents.", "[scattered applauding]", "And next,", "we're gonna add,", "air and water currents.", "So here's the, that's kind of not the equator,", "well close enough, so here's the equator.", "And generally energy on our world,", "kind of flows in this pattern.", "And it's just important to kind of keep that in mind", "as we're writing, and that is because", "when you're trying to convince an audience", "that is intimately familiar with one planet,", "you have to make sure that you are.", "Granted we know that, and in reality other planets", "outside of our own world are gonna be different.", "They're not going to have the same plate tectonics.", "They're not going to have the same energy", "being put into their eco systems and so forth.", "So we understand that these planets", "are gonna be different, but your audience may not.", "And so at the end of the day you've got", "to convince them that you know what you're doing.", "So if you put a desert at the equator, for example.", "You can, it needs to be in the middle of a continent", "like the Sahara is, or people won't believe you", "when you say that it's the desert.", "Because in our world at the equator,", "most of our climates tend to be tropical.", "So you've got to convince them.", "So what this means is that this is", "gonna be sort of your tropical zone,", "this is probably gonna be your temperate zone,", "this is gonna your arctic zone, same as on our world.", "You also have to keep in mind water currents.", "Water currents are gonna flow,", "remembering this pattern, sort of.", "Oh this is very light.", "I'm sorry I thought this would be easier to see.", "So we're gonna have something like the Gulf Stream", "kind of going in these directions.", "All right so what this means is that through this area", "right here we're gonna have some fairly", "swift flowing, and probably dangerous seas.", "Ditto here, oh especially right here.", "Okay here, okay here, cold, cold, that's easy.", "All right so now we need another volunteer to come up", "and decide where this story is going to take place.", "I will call on somebody I swear.", "All right, yes.", "All right, so just pick an X marks the spot.", "You can put it on land or you can put it on water.", "And you tell us where the story will take place.", "Now while she's doing that, while she's picking", "a place where she wants our culture to develop,", "because that's what we're gonna end up talking about,", "I usually throw in somewhere in this area.", "I prefer to do it around ecology personally.", "But you can do it in a lot of different places.", "So you can throw in, because we're talking about", "science fiction and fantasy, an element X.", "Now the element X doesn't have to be something overt.", "The planet itself is already an element X.", "So you don't have to go any more hard than that.", "But if you want to insert aliens, whatever,", "you can do that at this time, and get creative with it.", "But you do have to remember that everything", "below that level, everything in that pyramid", "that I just showed you of macro world building", "will be affected by that element X going on down.", "We apply element X to the real world", "all the time, by the way, the placebo effect,", "thoughts and prayers, how's that working out?", "Climate change, the idea that it ain't happening.", "That's complete crap.", "Deferred maintenance of our infrastructure.", "I live in New York, our subway system is breaking down", "because for a good solid 10, 15 years or so", "the various politicians in our state decided", "oh, the subway doesn't need any maintenance.", "What's that maintenance thing?", "Anyway, I'm horribly jealous of your public", "transportation here in San Francisco, it works,", "doesn't catch fire, doesn't explode, I'm good with that.", "We're gonna get our coal back, another example.", "You may have heard that from someone.", "All right these are some examples of", "how it has happened in the past, with the element X.", "Pizza world, that was when I gave", "the presentation to the 12 year olds.", "They were hungry, so we ended up with", "an obviously artificially created archipelago", "that resembled 12 slices of pizza in a circle.", "And then on another world, with the addition of", "the element X we had something called The Hungry Sea.", "It was a sentient gulf current, gulf stream,", "a sentient gulf stream that traveled the planet.", "Like the rest of the water was fine,", "but there was this one current of water", "that would eat your ships, and you, and didn't like people.", "So, and it was aware, it just didn't like you.", "So that was part of it.", "Now where did you put your X?", "Let's see.", "Oh you like the place of conflict.", "All right, so on the water, interesting.", "All right, thank you very much, all right.", "So what this means, first and foremost,", "water is not a barrier to habitation.", "Water is not a barrier to, scratch

think I'm ever gonna do this again.", "I mean I'll do what my muse seems to want me to do.", "But I do often, for me usually character does come first.", "I do then have to run the world building

you seemed really well versed in science,", "and I think you just demonstrated how", "important science is to world building,", "keeping up with the latest science.", "But I'm curious your reading habits.", "Do you read the latest journals?", "Do you just pick up science here as it comes to you?", "Do you go out and seek it?", "Okay, to so the question is since there's", "a lot of science in my

answer, which is an option.", "What do you think are the biggest pitfalls in", "when people are world building and writing that you see?", "Also, have you read slash watched Game of Thrones,", "and where do you think he may have--", "[laughing]", "[Student] Flubbed up world building?", "Okay, so I don't actually watch Game of Thrones.", "I watch people watching Game of Thrones.", "[students laughing]", "Like I find watching Twitter on Game of Thrones night", "is more exciting than any sports ball ever,", "'cause people get like super into it.", "And it's like watching a game,", "it's like suddenly Twitter erupts with this mass roar", "of approval because somebody got stabbed, whatever.", "The first half of your question was", "where do people typically screw up in world

not.", "I know that people were certainly invested in it,", "which means that enough of a good job was done", "that people were able to buy it.", "It didn't kick anybody in the audience", "out on the level of plausibility.", "But so obviously that worked well enough to go there.", "So that's really it.", "If you're if you're gonna not do the world building,", "and you're gonna go into this

what would a conference", "of tentacle sharks be like, I don't know,", "then you're not doing your job as a creator.", "All right let's get more questions.", "There was one here, one there, and then one there.", "So here, there, and there, yes?", "[Student] So I'm really impressed in the ability", "of what I now understand your macro world building.", "Thank you.", "[Student] Yeah, and how you really get into and between", "different cultures, and races, and everything.", "I'm honestly curious if you have any recommendations", "about how to approach doing that--", "Doing what?", "[Student] Doing some kind of really good", "macro world building without being pedantic.", "I don't know, does that make sense?", "Other than the method I just showed you,", "or what do you mean?", "[Student] If you get into power dynamics,", "maybe just applying what you understand", "and just filling the world we have now with people.", "But how do you talk about some of the dynamics", "without coming across as pedantic, or?", "So, if I'm, okay let me rephrase", "that and see if I'm getting it.", "Basically you want to know like how", "basic sociology, or specific dynamics?", "Because like the power dynamics in general takes", "a lot of different forms in our society.", "If you want to learn, for example, about racism", "then you should specialize in delving into work about that.", "If you want to learn, now granted, all of it serves the same", "hierarchy, the same structural oppression which supports,", "each flavor of oppression tends to support others.", "And that is the nature of

that.", "If you're talking about disability stuff.", "I'm not sure I understand, is that what you're asking is", "how do you learn more about the sociology?", "[Student] Yeah, maybe that's what it is.", "Okay.", "[Student] Sort of delving in and doing", "more research on the things you want to explore.", "Okay, the simplest thing is to find experts in that field.", "They will have almost always put out lists of resources,", "or they'll cite resources that they themselves are checking.", "And you can always look in the notes", "of that and find sort of basic info.", "A really simple technique that my niece taught me,", "was go to Wikipedia look at the sources.", "You want to know all about, whatever, classism.", "Go look up classism on Wikipedia and go look at the sources.", "And a lot of those sources will include scholarly articles.", "But there are some novels, not novels whoa.", "There are gonna be some books,", "including fairly accessible textbooks", "usually that are gonna be in there.", "So I don't know if that's answering your question-ish?", "Okay, all right.", "Was that you yes, okay.", "[Student] So my question was kind of is about the role", "of collaboration in the creative process of world building.", "Where it's so, a lot of detail there,", "and a lot of like personal creativity that comes out of it.", "What is the role of collaboration?", "When you get that feedback,", "how much of it do you use to incorporate?", "Okay, so the question was what is the role", "of collaboration in world building?", "And I can only tell you that I've mostly done", "collaboration in exercises like this.", "And you have probably felt some of the", "tension that is inherent in collaborative world building.", "I'm sure that some of you are like tentacle sharks,", "I don't want no tentacle sharks in my world.", "I want, I don't know, human beings", "who are gonna build hydrofoils or whatever, I don't know.", "When you are creating by committee,", "you're inherently going to privilege the loudest voices,", "the assertive people who spoke up,", "the people who volunteered to come up", "and mark the Xs, and things like that.", "Thank you, all of you.", "But what it does mean when you're doing that", "is that it can be a little difficult.", "Beyond that, I honestly haven't had", "a lot of experience collaborating.", "Novel writing tends to be a solitary activity.", "The closest I can come to it is that I am writing", "a Green Lantern comic right now, or have written.", "It's coming out next week, I'm so excited.", "But so I did 12 issues of a book called,", "Green Lantern Far Sector,", "which will be out from DC next week.", "It's the first time that I've collaborated with an artist.", "And that's been an interesting experience.", "So, this takes place in a very secondary world.", "It's not Earth, unlike many of", "the other Green Lantern series.", "And so I created three species, a society of three species", "that this story would take place in.", "One of those species is relatively human looking,", "but because they come from a society that was kind of,", "that come from a planet that was more like a death world,", "they've got some physical adaptations.", "I feel like basically they started out in kind of", "the same general primate place that we did,", "but they kept more prehensile hands,", "like a tail, they kept a tail.", "They developed the ability to glide", "like flying squirrels, anyway.", "One of the adaptations that I wanted", "them to have was seven fingers.", "And in my head that was just like, point point,", "extra hand, extra fingers they're.", "The artist though was like, that doesn't make any sense.", "Why would they have just extra fingers?", "We don't have seven fingers.", "We were perfectly able to climb in our previous", "species variations with fewer fingers.", "The only evolutionary reason that they would", "have more fingers as if one of them is a thumb.", "So they have a secondary thumb.", "So the way that he's decided to draw", "this thing that I just wrote in,", "which in my head was just like oh, seven fingers,", "whatever, seven, nine, however many.", "So they now have a hand that is sort of distinctly visually", "different from ours, and actually can grasp more.", "And it means that all of their,", "like their cups are different.", "We had to have a discussion about like a coffee cup,", "because I had been thinking that", "it would just be a regular coffee cup.", "No, they've got like multiple fingers.", "They can pick it up with like a thumb from either side.", "It would have like two handles.", "All their cups have two handles, little stuff like that.", "That's been a fantastic experience.", "Because, with another creator who's of like amazing talent,", "then it becomes an exciting exercise, it becomes fun.", "We sort of riff on each other.", "On the other hand he's not a writer.", "I don't know how I would react to another writer.", "I might get territorial, I don't know.", "So I can't speak to collaboration beyond that.", "There was a hand, yes okay.", "[Student] There's been a lot of focus on", "actually improving on things that give people credit.", "Because what I've noticed is a lot of people", "that are writing for another culture.", "So let's say they're representing someone", "who's not American for example.", "A lot of times it, at best, comes across an", "anthropologist citing a recent study, sort of people", "actually just writing their perspective on it.", "And the work is just a bland white American", "who's actually writing from another perspective,", "but just phrasing it in a different way.", "Is there a way for someone to actually include", "the voices of another people more affectively,", "especially if they don't really know much about them?", "So this is a huge debate in the fiction world right now.", "Cultural appropriation discussion,", "is what we call this particular area of the field.", "Is it appropriate to", "write about cultures other than your own?", "Are you appropriating their stories", "for your own in the process?", "Are you harming them when you do this?", "Is there a way to do it non harmfully?", "This is a huge discussion and it's not something that I can", "answer in like the few seconds that we probably have left,", "and we're gonna have to wind this down in a bit.", "But I will say there is a really great resource", "that I recommend to all writers as sort of a starter", "for this discussion, which is a book called,", "Writing the Other, by Nisi Shawl and Cynthia Ward.", "It's a small chat book from an Indie press so it's,", "you can find it, but it doesn't cost that much.", "But you're probably not gonna see it", "in like Barnes & Noble is what I mean.", "So you're gonna have to order it online.", "But it's a really great novel that's,", "not novel, why do I keep saying novel?", "It's a really great text book that helps you", "sort of ask those basic questions about", "what is appropriate appropriation.", "Human being's gonna human being.", "It is our nature that we borrow and use ideas", "from other people, and we as writers should have", "the ability to empathize with other groups", "of people no matter how different, especially in my field.", "If you can empathize with an alien or a robot,", "you should be able to empathize with every other", "variation of human being that exists out there.", "The question becomes should you tell their stories?", "Or should you simply include them in", "the story that you're gonna tell?", "Doing that is something all writers should be able to do.", "But if you choose to make your protagonist", "a member of a group where you, for example,", "have more privilege relative to them,", "you could be drowning out the voice of a writer", "from that group who wants to tell their own story.", "So these are huge, huge discussions.", "And there is no simple solution or narrow down on it.", "But you should join that discussion if it is", "a thing that is of interest to you.", "And a good starter is that book.", "All right let's take three more questions, here, there,", "and there, and I think that we will then be out of time.", "[Student] So I was just gonna ask,", "if you wanted to create a religion in your world,", "where would you put that into the world building process,", "and how would you go about doing that?", "Well, when I wrote my, Inheritance Trilogy,", "which very much included its own religion.", "The, Inheritance Trilogy, for those that haven't", "read it takes place in a universe where", "the gods are visible, not only visible but", "they're walking around talking to folks.", "And the gods who created the universe", "had a little falling out.", "There were three of them, they had a spat,", "one of them ends up dead, one of them ends up", "sort of the ascendant god, and then one of them", "ends up as basically given to the the favored servants", "of the one who was ascendant as a slave.", "And several of their godly", "children are also treated that way.", "And of course the humans immediately are like hey,", "we literally have a living weapon of mass destruction here.", "If we want to smite some people that", "piss us off, we can literally smite them.", "So that whole trilogy explores that religion.", "So in that case I included it at the universal level,", "because this is a society, or this is a world,", "in which we know how the universe was created,", "because the gods literally showed up and told us.", "And we had no reason not to believe", "them because they could smite us.", "So it's not our world, it's not Earth.", "Everything about the society is is different, though,", "because the gods are there and present.", "And later on in the series the gods actually start", "getting involved in human politics, and so forth.", "It gets a little messy.", "But there's like a whole trilogy there.", "Actually the Dreamblood books do this too,", "now that I think about it.", "Actually all of my books explore religion.", "Okay, well alright so, just read 10 books, you got it.", "I'm kidding, I'm kidding.", "Religion, in a lot of cases, this is why I was", "talking about, for example, cosmogony.", "If you, and this is why we went through this exercise,", "so you could see for example these continents do not look", "artificial, granted they they're a little smooth", "on the edges but these continents do not look artificial,", "versus pizza world, where in that world everyone", "knew from jump that somebody had created that planet.", "It makes a gigantic difference in how that society develops.", "So I wanted to talk about the fact that where you choose", "to insert the evidence of a higher power", "dictates how that society develops.", "You can insert it at the universal level,", "and if you do then literally everything changes.", "You can insert it at just the acculturation level,", "and then you're gonna have multiple groups of people", "with different ways of viewing the world.", "Even in the, Inheritance Trilogy, though", "I wanted to include like a role for atheists.", "They could be talking to a god and say,", "not that I don't believe in you,", "but I kind of believe in humans more.", "So that was what atheist meant on a world", "where the gods would show up and like knock on your door.", "So I had to explore all of that.", "But there's, apparently I tackle that subject a lot though.", "If you read my books there will be", "many variations that you see, I guess.", "I'm not encouraging you to read my books.", "Yes I am, okay.", "Yes, sorry.", "[Student] So let's assume that we're in this world,", "day five and that happens to many things.", "What story would you like to share about the world by then?", "Over the past two years that have passed.", "Oh you want me to do some futurism.", "I hate doing that,", "largely because science fiction and fantasy writers,", "science fiction writers tend to be really bad at futurism.", "I don't know why anybody thinks that we are good at this,", "Because a few science, if you ever go back", "and look at old science fiction novels,", "in a few cases they will get bits of technology right.", "What we tend not to get right is how", "human beings react to that technology.", "So you will find, for example, any number of", "cyberpunk novels that correctly predicted the internet,", "or correctly predicted AI as we use it now, scratch that.", "AI as given what it is capable of doing now.", "Very few science fiction writers, none that I know of,", "predicted that we would have disinformation campaigns,", "with bots all over our social media and things like that.", "Very few people predicted that not everyone", "would have access to the internet still in the year 20,", "what year is this, oh my God, 2019, wow.", "So I am possibly one of the worst people in here", "for futurism, and the tendency to center on technology", "is one of the worst ways of focusing on futurism.", "What we need to look at is the ways in which", "human beings are evolving, societally speaking.", "I don't mean physically.", "Well it could be that too, just real slow.", "So I have no predictions for that because I don't know.", "I have hopes, I have a great deal of hope", "that we will eventually start to realize that", "allowing certain kinds of
