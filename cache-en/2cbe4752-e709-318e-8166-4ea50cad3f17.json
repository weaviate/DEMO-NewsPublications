The gardens at Blickling are spread over 55 acres of land and include both formal and informal areas, listed buildings, a kitchen garden, Victorian garden ornaments and mystifying woodland. The house itself is handsomely decorated, so be sure to take a wander along the spectacular Long Gallery, built by Sir Henry for social activity and exercise in bad weather. This afternoon we experience this beautiful county on one of the highlights of the tour, on arguably the best way to take in the Norfolk Broads. Starting our journey in Wroxham, admire pretty villages and wildlife along the way on a relaxing boat cruise. Interestingly, the Broads were thought to be natural features until the 1960s, when Dr Joyce Lambert found that they were in fact flooded Medieval peat excavations. Travelling by boat is the finest way to discover this wonderful area. As well as picturesque windmills dotted in the distance, it\u2019s a true paradise for wildlife, as home to countless rare plants, birds and animals. Gaze in awe at the likes of colourful kingfishers, bouncing otters and tawny bitterns hiding amongst the white waterlilies and rare fen orchids. Be sure to keep an eye out for Britain\u2019s largest butterfly too: the stunning and rare swallowtail can be identified by its pale, yellow wings laced by black and shades of dark blue and a touch of ruby red. We return to Norwich in the late afternoon for our final night to enjoy the nearby buzz of the beautiful city centre with luxurious surroundings."], "authors": [], "keywords": ["gardens", "garden", "royal", "wildlife", "blickling", "broads", "way", "sure", "decorated", "sandringham", "norfolk", "rare", "boat"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
