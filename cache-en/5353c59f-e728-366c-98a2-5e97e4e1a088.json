Cash!? I hadn\u2019t handed over a fistful of filthy bills since you could still call a certain Mexican beer by its proper name without a second thought. And the salt in the wound: a reloadable Fun Card from Deno\u2019s Wonder Wheel. Where is Deno\u2019s Wonder Wheel? (Coney Island, it turns out. See you in the summer of 2022.)", "For years I have been a large-bag person\u2014not only to accommodate this brick of a wallet but to make sure I could handle all manner of mishaps: laptops that had lost their charge, episodes of low blood sugar, blotchy skin, a westerly wind. There is nothing sexy about this Mary Poppins mode, as evidenced by the well-worn Prospect Park Alliance tote in which I carried all this junk. Once it was a fresh and creamy color; it now resembles the terrain it honors.", "But many months into the pandemic, my orbit has shrunk mostly to the blocks surrounding my Brooklyn home. It\u2019s almost a clich\u00e9 at this point to say that the pandemic has prompted us to streamline our lives, but when my oldest son\u2019s school sent home a note saying that backpacks would not be necessary this year (they were limiting what came in and out of the building for as long as in-person classes were allowed), I found myself wondering: If a first-grader could free himself from excess baggage, couldn\u2019t I?", "And the moment seemed right. For years now, Jacquemus\u2019s micro bag, about as tall as my pinky finger, has been more of an ubiquitous photo prop than practical vessel. But there has been a proliferation of purses that range from dainty\u2014like Gucci\u2019s mini Jackie bag\u2014to the truly petite, like several of Paco Rabanne\u2019s slinky chain-link sacs for spring 2021. The new Loewe bucket \u201cbag\u201d from their spring collection is shrunk to a doll-sized pouch, worn around the neck (Chanel, too, recently reinterpreted its classic 11.12 as a necklace), while Off-White\u2019s perforated \u201cMeteor Logo\u201d carrier has ID-card dimensions you might associate with something usually attached to a lanyard."], "authors": ["Chloe Schama", "Chloe Scham"], "keywords": ["pandemic", "small", "worn", "shrunk", "mule", "gave", "wonder", "pack", "future", "spring", "denos", "bag", "vogue", "editor", "wound", "wheel", "wallet", "life"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
