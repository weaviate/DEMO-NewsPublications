Photo: Derek Henderson", "IT\u2019S 9:30 ON A CRISP MORNING IN HUDSON, New York, and after lowering my mask and tightening my scarf against the chill, I lift a glass, pantomime a clink, and take a gulp of vodka. The 80-proof liquor is sweeter than I expected, with pleasant undertones of dark fruit. This isn\u2019t the most productive start to a workday\u2014I have just dropped my son at preschool\u2014but it\u2019s the least I can do to save the planet. Sobriety is a small price to pay for carbon sequestration.", "How am I sequestering carbon by drinking vodka? My husband asks this question, too, when I stumble home after my tasting. It\u2019s about which vodka I was drinking: Good Vodka from distiller and former GQ editor Mark Byrne. Good Vodka isn\u2019t made from fermented potatoes or wheat or corn, but from the mucilaginous wastewater produced by processing coffee beans.", "Does mucilaginous wastewater sound like something you don\u2019t want in your cocktail? Before you answer, consider the methods by which conventional spirits are produced. Sugar, such as fruit and grain, must be grown in a field, then harvested, processed, stored, bottled, and distributed\u2014which can translate into vast monocrops of grapes, wheat, and corn, dependent on millions of gallons of water and pounds of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers and fossil fuels. What\u2019s left behind is depleted topsoil and runoff. Simply putting spirits into heavy glass bottles has a massive carbon impact. And did you know that distillation itself\u2014particularly of whiskey\u2014creates toxic chemicals that seep into waterways and cause hypoxia zones in which fish perish? Doesn\u2019t mucilaginous coffee-bean wastewater sound better now?", "I\u2019d always thought of myself as a conscientious consumer. I\u2019m apparently not alone in that delusion. Claire Sprouse, owner of Brooklyn\u2019s low-waste, high-consciousness bar Hunky Dory, says most ethical eaters ignore the provenance of hard liquor. \u201cThere\u2019s been this shift in our eating and drinking culture: people buying fair-trade coffee and local produce. But there\u2019s a disconnect when it comes to spirits. We don\u2019t think of them as part of agriculture.\u201d"], "authors": ["Tamar Adler", "Tamar Adle"], "keywords": ["carbon", "cocktail", "spirits", "wastewater", "wheat", "sound", "good", "drinking", "planet", "help", "save", "vodka", "theres", "mucilaginous"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
