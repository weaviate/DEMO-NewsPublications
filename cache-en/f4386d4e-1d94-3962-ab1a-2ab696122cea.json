I was tall, gangly, excitable. Less than a week earlier, following a brief stretch of test-taking at the Department of Motor Vehicles in San Francisco, I had received my learner\u2019s permit. Learning in those days seemed easy. Tests were easy. Doing\u2014when the matter arose at all\u2014was hard. Behind the wheel, I made a show of adjusting the mirrors, as if preparing for a ten-mile journey in reverse. I surveyed the blank pavement ahead of me and slowly slid the gear-shift from park into drive.", "Cars had been my first passion. As a two-year-old, I\u2019d learned to recognize the make of vehicles by the logo near the fender or perched on the hood. I grew to understand the people in my life according to their cars; I learned what sort of person I was from my parents\u2019 two old Hondas, one of which, a used beige Accord, I had gone with them to buy. My father\u2019s lingering bachelor vehicle, a rotting yellow Civic, needed to be choked awake on dewy mornings, and I\u2019d performed that job with relish, pulling out the knob beside the steering wheel, waiting a long moment, and pushing it back. This was the late eighties. Gas prices had fallen, and the roads were knotty with cars from across the world. I no longer remember what, as a small child, I envisaged for my future, but I know that it involved moving at speed behind the wheel.", "Now, all those years later, the parking lot was virtually empty of cars, and I felt a flush of reassurance. I was learning in my parents\u2019 highly defatigable ride, a minivan with an all-plastic interior and the turning radius of a dump truck. My teacher was my father, a flawless but not wholly valiant driver, who habitually refused to drive on certain bridges in certain directions, for fear of being, as he would put it, \u201chypnotized\u201d by trusses passing alongside the road. For reasons lost to time, my little sister was on board, too, in the back. I eased my foot onto the gas; the engine revved for a moment, and the van lurched.", "For the first time, I felt the seething power of the thing\u2014not as a conveyance, which is how I had known cars in the past, but as a huge appetitive machine that interacted with the world through its own strength and expressed urges I did not. I was, I realized with a start, embarrassed at the wheel. It felt like being observed during a first attempt at slow dancing; my impulse almost at once was to use the brake. I did, and now it was my father and my sister who lurched.", "\u201cOh, my God,\u201d my sister said.", "\u201cMaybe a little bit gentler,\u201d my father noted, sounding oddly placid, maybe hypnotized.", "I tried again for forward motion, this time travelling what felt to me like a great distance at great speed. A few parked cars that had seemed safely remote drew very close. I braked again and surveyed my progress over my left shoulder. I\u2019d achieved a commute of about ten feet.", "Until then, despite having been in cars all my life, I\u2019d failed to recognize the ease with which an errant movement, the equivalent of knocking into someone on a crowded bus, could bring about an injury or a death. As I jolted around the lot, I imagined myself on the road, in traffic, and felt a tight spasm of panic in my chest. I was eighteen. It had been all I could manage to remain on top of my un-botchable after-school job watering the neighbors\u2019 bonsai trees. By the end of day, the idea of not driving\u2014of not entering a future in which, day to day, I\u2019d risk becoming an accidental killer of children\u2014seemed freeing and bright. I never had a second lesson.", "For years, I counted this inability to drive as one of many personal failures. More recently, I\u2019ve wondered whether I performed an accidental kindness for the world. I am one of those Darth Vader pedestrians who loudly tailgate couples moving slowly up the sidewalk, and I\u2019m sure that I would be a twit behind the wheel. Perhaps I was protected from a bad move by my own incompetence\u2014one of those mercies which the universe often bestows on the young (who rarely appreciate the gift). In America today, there are more cars than drivers. Yet our investment in these vehicles has yielded dubious returns. Since 1899, more than 3.6 million people have died in traffic accidents in the United States, and more than eighty million have been injured; pedestrian fatalities have risen in the past few years. The road has emerged as the setting for our most violent illustrations of systemic racism, combustion engines have helped create a climate crisis, and the quest for oil has led our soldiers into war.", "Every technology has costs, but lately we\u2019ve had reason to question even cars\u2019 putative benefits. Free men and women on the open road have turned out to be such disastrous drivers that carmakers are developing computers to replace them. When the people of the future look back at our century of auto life, will they regard it as a useful stage of forward motion or as a wrong turn? Is it possible that, a hundred years from now, the age of gassing up and driving will be seen as just a cul-de-sac in transportation history, a trip we never should have taken?", "Among the captivating books to land on my desk recently was Dan Albert\u2019s \u201cAre We There Yet?: The American Automobile Past, Present, and Driverless,\u201d which notes that, in the late nineteenth century, electric cars and gasoline cars developed side by side. One assumes that electrics were only notionally in the running at this stage. Surprisingly, Albert reports, gas cars were the B-fleet for years.", "Turn-of-the-century electric cars were more maneuverable than their gasoline-powered counterparts. They had faster acceleration, better braking, and powerful torque, which compensated for the heft of their batteries. They set land-speed records\u2014in 1902, an electric car briefly attained an astonishing hundred and two miles per hour\u2014and, unlike internal-combustion vehicles, didn\u2019t sputter out in traffic and need to be cranked up in the middle of the road. True, they had to be recharged every forty miles or so, about the distance from Mount Vernon to Grand Central Terminal and back, but few early motorists were travelling much farther. Electrical power was the moon shot of its age, quiet, futuristic, and the vanguard of human accomplishment. When Albert A. Pope, the head of the Columbia bicycle company, entered the car business, in 1896, he invested in electrics. \u201cYou can\u2019t get people to sit over an explosion,\u201d he explained.", "Pope declared bankruptcy in 1907. Why did finicky, explosive gas cars win the field? Albert is a car guy by passion and vocation, a former curator of vehicle collections at the Science Museum in London. Today, he identifies himself as \u201cn+1\u2019s car critic,\u201d an assignment that he clearly prosecutes with seriousness and pride. His book is interesting and idiosyncratic, occasionally at the same time, and tracks cars\u2019 changing social and cultural position with an elegiac tone. \u201cThe road was once an open-ended adventure, full of wrong turns and serendipitous discoveries,\u201d Albert writes. \u201cNow the phone knows every mile and every minute before we leave the garage.\u201d", "The adventure part, he thinks, explains why electrics ultimately fell away. Because electric engines were expensive to produce, a coalition called the Electric Vehicle Company formed to lease them to operators, as taxis, or perhaps rent them, \u00e0 la Zipcar. The business was profitable, but, in the style of Uber, the company decided that it was vulnerable to competition unless it could take over the whole country at once. That expansion attempt set off alarms about monopoly, and, after reporters found one of the company\u2019s loans to be fraudulent, the business of shared-use electric cars collapsed.", "It helped that, by then, electric vehicles were struggling culturally, for reasons we would now call gendered. \u201cThe internal-combustion car that had to be coaxed and muscled to life, with its lubes and explosions and thrusting pistons, that would be the car for men,\u201d Albert writes. Electrics\u2014quiet, practical, and, in one engineer\u2019s estimation, \u201ctame\u201d\u2014took on female associations. Not for the last time, the makers of gas cars didn\u2019t so much win the market as create a market they could win. The triumph of gas engines entailed a shift in the whole transportation model\u2014from shared cars to privately owned cars, from an extension of the metropolitan network to a vehicle that required infrastructure of its own. \u201cHad this period of random technological mutation selected for the electric, the social history of America would be unrecognizable,\u201d Albert notes.", "In 1909, there were two million horse-drawn carriages manufactured in the United States and eighty thousand automobiles. By 1923, there were ten thousand carriages manufactured and four million cars; by 1930, more than half the families in the United States were car owners, and the horses went to pasture. A key factor in the explosion of the market was the release of the Model T, created by Henry Ford, in 1908. Ford was an unmannered, intellectually narrow efficiency nut of the sort that we might now associate with Silicon Valley. Early in his career, he accused milk cows of being underproductive and sought to develop a soy milk to replace them. Later, he joined George Washington Carver in preparing \u201cweed spread\u201d sandwiches from greens he found in his yard, an attempt to maximize nutrition with minimal waste. Ford served the nasty sandwiches to his colleagues, and didn\u2019t understand why they never caught on.", "The Model T, though, marked an alignment of Ford\u2019s abstemious style with demand. The car, of which more than fifteen million were produced, was cheap, light, reliable enough, and so stripped-down that it sustained an industry of third-party add-ons. (Albert calls it \u201can open-source car\u201d; the standard model lacked a speedometer, a mirror, or a gas gauge.) In those days, cars were seen as environmentally friendly: unlike horses, they didn\u2019t befoul the streets, and they carried passengers closer to the remote natural world than any other transportation did. In Albert\u2019s telling, the versatile Model T further de-urbanized the automobile, turning it private, populist, and rural. At a moment when cities were building out their transit systems, the places between places in America filled up with middle-class cars.", "\u201cThe Model T\u2019s spiritual descendants are the Ford F-Series pickups,\u201d Albert writes. \u201cThese body-on-frame vehicles defy change and modernization. Let the Europhiles in Boston drive their Swedish Volvos and the Los Angeles elites have their holier-than-thou Teslas; let New Yorkers rely on ride hailing and Mobility-as-a-Service. We F150 drivers will stick to a rugged American vehicle at home in the heartland.\u201d Appearing quickly, pervasively, and years ahead of exurban infrastructure, the Model T helped to define the differently navigable regions of identity now known as red and blue America.", "A famous film reel, shot on Market Street, in San Francisco, in 1906, shows carriages, early cars, streetcars, cable cars, and pedestrians swerving around one another, in both directions, in a terrifying free-for-all across the urban road. By the interwar years, the turf of privately owned cars alone was so ungovernable that its chaos became a metaphor. \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d reaches its climax in a car crash, and many real-world stories ended that way, too. (Fitzgerald died the same weekend that Nathanael West, his comrade in Southern California dissipation, plowed a Ford through a boulevard stop and into a two-door sedan, killing himself and his wife\u2014a coincidence that is either rich in literary irony or just proof of how bad the odds on the roads were.) When Jordan Baker, in Fitzgerald\u2019s novel, observed, \u201cIt takes two to make an accident,\u201d she wasn\u2019t talking only about men and women.", "Sane, upstanding pedestrians didn\u2019t murder one another as they ran errands around town. Sane, upstanding drivers did, or might at any moment, and thus required a new style of policing. \u201cHow could a democratic society founded on self-governance depend on police governance and still be free?\u201d Sarah A. Seo, a law professor at the University of Iowa, writes in her remarkable new book, \u201cPolicing the Open Road: How Cars Transformed American Freedom.\u201d \u201cHow could the laws be fashioned to allow the investigation of potential criminal suspects without harassing law-abiding citizens when everybody drove?\u201d", "Seo\u2019s idea is that the problem of policing cars, far from being a remote corner of the law, is central to how the jurisprudence of the Fourth Amendment (searches and seizures) took shape during the past hundred years. Automobiles, after the Model T\u2019s expansion of personal ownership, confounded the parameters of the amendment: a car would seem to be private property, but roads were public, and the conduct of cars\u2014traffic, transport\u2014was a matter of public concern. The issue became pressing, legally, during Prohibition, when smugglers began using privately owned cars to traffic hooch.", "A turning point arrived in the bootlegging case Carroll v. United States, decided in 1925. The Supreme Court Chief Justice William Howard Taft wrote, \u201cThe seizing officer shall have reasonable or probable cause for believing that the automobile which he stops and seizes has contraband liquor therein.\u201d In Seo\u2019s view, Taft\u2019s opinion \u201cshifted Fourth Amendment jurisprudence from a categorical analysis\u2014is the automobile, as a category, public or private?\u2014to an individualized determination of reasonableness\u2014was this particular search reasonable?\u2014to determine the warrant question.\u201d The person who did the determining, under this new standard, was an officer of the law.", "This kernel of police empowerment grew to fit the contours and the concerns of each age that followed. \u201cAt midcentury, the problem was the potential for police action without basis in law,\u201d Seo tells us. \u201cAt century\u2019s end, the problem had become police action that did have a basis in law but that departed from normal practice\u201d\u2014specifically, the ways police approached drivers of color. A version of the matter came before the high court in 1996, in Whren v. United States, a case about a traffic stop\u2014for turning too fast and without signalling\u2014that ended in drug convictions. The petitioner\u2019s claim was that the motorist was really stopped because of racial profiling, and that the traffic infraction was a pretext. Maybe so, the Court unanimously held, but such stops were fine so long as there was an objective basis for them, \u201cwhatever the subjective intent.\u201d Decisions like these can inform the thinking about search-and-seizure norms far more broadly, potentially affecting everything from exploratory K-9 searches to the use of data gathered from smartphones.", "There are two strong claims in favor of the idea that our century-long adventure in owning and crashing gasoline cars was, although not perfect, a step forward. The first is infrastructural: cars let Americans cross cities, states, woods, mountains, deserts, and, ultimately, the nation in reasonable time. Cities and towns thrived with the flow. The second is cultural: the idea that car travel conjugates American life in its healthiest and most distinctive forms. Both arguments took root in the two-decade period after the Second World War.", "Albert holds that the war brought down the curtain on the sinister, crashy, Gatsbyesque idea of the road. American car travel almost halved between 1941 and 1943, largely owing to wartime rubber shortages and gas rations. Companies stopped making cars, and instead manufactured planes, guns, and battlefield transportation\u2014work that, Albert suggests, gave these companies a patriotic glow when production resumed after the war. By then, the West was settling into conflict with the East, and a new project was under way. The world had to be persuaded of the freedoms of American life. Cars could be of help. In 1956, President Eisenhower signed the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act, inaugurating the federal highways as the largest public-works project in U.S. history. (Albert is at pains to claim the system for the F.D.R. Administration, which first sketched it out.) The interstates were strategically versatile: they could carry commuters and goods in peacetime and soldiers and evacuees in an emergency. They were also smoother, safer, and more capacious than previous highways, boosting the allure of the open road."], "authors": ["Nathan Heller", "Nathan Helle", "Charles Duhig", "Ian Frazie"], "keywords": ["model", "electric", "cars", "road", "albert", "world", "automotive", "era", "mistake", "vehicles", "traffic", "car", "terrible", "gas"], "pubDate": "2019-07-29T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
